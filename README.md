## Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) mocdeling vs. Feature-Based Parametric Modeling

It seems in CAD modelling one can differentiate between 'Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) mocdeling' vs. 'Feature-Based Parametric Modeling'.

The FreeCad 'Part' workbench seems to provide 'Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) mocdeling'?

And FreeCad 'Part Design' workbench seems to provide 'Feature-Based Parametric Modeling'?

Now this does not explain the confusing naming of these 'benches'. I suppose better names would have been 'CSG Workbench' and 'Feature modeling workbench'? But then, maybe this is also confusing in its own way?

I suppose the wikipedia article 'Constructive solid geometry' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry) could be a good starting point to understand how and when to prefer CSG modeling and the Freecad 'Part' workbench?

And in the same way this article 'What is feature-based modeling?' (https://www.engineering.com/what-is-feature-based-modeling/) could be an equally good starting point to understand feature Based Modeling and the 'Part Design' workbench?

## My experience doing \<Help>/\<BIM Tutorial>

### Confusing 3D view after changing 'Current working plane'
After I have Changed the 'Current working plane' the 3D views looks like my 3D model has been translated!

This is beacuse I am used to having the grid at a fix reference plane like the x-y-plane. So when I place the working plan say at the top of the walls - it looks like the walls now are placed under the x-y-plane. I suppose you can get used to this but for now I have to learn to understand this.
