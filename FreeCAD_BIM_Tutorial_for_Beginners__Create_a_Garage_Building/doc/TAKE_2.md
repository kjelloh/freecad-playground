# My comments while modelling for the second time the house in youtube video 'FreeCAD BIM Tutorial for Beginners | Create a Garage Building'

See [https://youtu.be/WZHyUBfdgJA?list=PL3wRqQUPtE16yw_c1TnRYJmz37y2ZRTLm](https://youtu.be/WZHyUBfdgJA?list=PL3wRqQUPtE16yw_c1TnRYJmz37y2ZRTLm)

I created the take_2 model file 'FreeCAD_BIM_Tutorial_for_Beginners__Create_a_Garage_Building_take_2.FCStd'.

## The plan view

The plan view at video 7:55 shows also the wall thickness 400 mm.

Some key properties are:

* Width: 8400 mm, depth: 6200
* The external wall is **inside** the 8400x6200 house wall perimeter.
* The external wall thickness is 400 mm

## Beware 'Snap to the Grid' is its own setting (See 'hash' icon)

I had already forgot the 'Snap grid' setting and icon! Without this setting it is hard to draw the rectangle attached at origo.
